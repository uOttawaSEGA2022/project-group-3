# Project Description

We are developing an Ottawa-based meal sharing application called “Mealer” (name a work in progress) where local cooks
can sell meals to clients from their home. The application supports three types of users:

    • Cook: a user that makes meals at home and sells them to Clients.
    • Client: a user that buys meals from Cooks. They order the meal through the application
    and pick it up from the Cook’s home.
    • Administrator: a user that receives complaints about a Cook from a Client and may
    suspend the Cook if necessary
